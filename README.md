**##### Vacceed  #####**

Vacceed is the collective name for a framework of linked bioinformatics programs, Perl scripts, R functions, and Linux scripts. 
It has been designed to facilitate an automated, high-throughput in silico approach to vaccine candidate discovery
for eukaryotic pathogens.
 
Note that Vacceed has been designed for a Linux operating system and has only been tested on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5, 
but is expected to work on most Linux distributions.
